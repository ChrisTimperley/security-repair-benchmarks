Support for Baseline Darjeeling
===============================

In addition to supporting HiFix and ExtractFix, we aim to support the original, baseline version of Darjeeling on this benchmark.
We provide a script, `generate-darjeeling-config.py <https://github.com/squaresLab/security-repair-benchmarks/blob/main/scripts/generate-darjeeling-config.py>`_, that automatically generates a Darjeeling configuration file for a given scenario (specified by its directory) by using the information provided in the :code:`bug.json` file for that bug scenario.
